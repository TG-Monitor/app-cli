# TG-Monitor CLI Application

**Version: 0.0.4**

TG-Monitor application with CLI user interface.

## Notes

- The CLI runs in the same process as the monitor, thus, quitting the CLI terminates the monitor.
- Logged-in Telegram session is saved persistently in `/var/tmp/tg-monitor/telethon` on local machine. So, there is no need to log in at each run of the application.
